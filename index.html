          Zo!

          <br>
          Your office buddy learns there is free food scattered around the office, but she is stuck in a meeting and cannot get it.
          She asks you to get food (pink squares) and bring it back to her (green square).
          <br>
          <br>
          However, you must be careful to avoid those chatty Kathys in the office. Theyâ€™ll want your help fixing their computer and will interrupt the mission.
          If you try to pass through a square occupied by a coworker (orange square), you will have to start over - so pay attention!
          <br>
          <br>
          Once you bring all the snacks back to your coworker, you win!
          <br>
          <br>
          Goodluck!
